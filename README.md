# NLP Learning Website

A comprehensive website explaining Natural Language Processing (NLP) for beginners using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This website provides a detailed introduction to Natural Language Processing, covering:

- What NLP is and its importance
- History and evolution of NLP
- Core concepts and techniques
- Applications of NLP in the real world
- Detailed explanation of how chatbots work, including technical implementation details
- Examples of NLP in everyday life
- Learning resources for further exploration

## Features

- **Interactive Demo**: Try a simple text analysis tool that demonstrates basic NLP concepts
- **Visual Timeline**: Learn about the historical development of NLP
- **Concept Cards**: Understand core NLP concepts through clear explanations and examples
- **Word Embeddings Deep Dive**: Comprehensive explanation of tokenization and word embedding techniques with visualizations
- **Chatbot Deep Dive**: Detailed explanation of chatbot architecture, evolution, and technical implementation
- **Code Examples**: Pseudocode examples showing how chatbot components work behind the scenes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure and content
- `styles.css` - All styling and responsive design rules
- `script.js` - Interactive functionality including the NLP demo

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Navigate through the sections using the navigation bar
4. Try the interactive demo in the introduction section by typing some text and clicking "Analyze Text"

## Technical Details

This website is built with:

- **HTML5** for structure and content
- **CSS3** for styling, including CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- **JavaScript** (ES6+) for interactivity

No external libraries or frameworks are used - everything is implemented with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## NLP Demo Implementation

The interactive demo demonstrates simplified versions of key NLP concepts:

- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into words
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Identifying positive/negative sentiment
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Finding potential proper nouns
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Identifying the most common words

Note: This is a simplified educational implementation. In a production environment, you would use established NLP libraries like spaCy, NLTK, or transformer models.

## Recently Added

- **Comprehensive Chatbot Section**: In-depth explanation of how chatbots work, including types of chatbots, architecture components, and the evolution of conversational AI technology
- **Interactive Thought Experiments**: Examples that demonstrate increasing levels of complexity in chatbot processing
- **Technical Implementation Details**: Code-like examples and technical explanations of the internal workings of chatbots, including preprocessing, NLU, dialog management, and response generation
- **Visual Pipeline Representation**: Clear visualization of the complete chatbot processing pipeline
- **Word Embeddings & Tokenization Section**: Detailed exploration of how computers transform text into mathematical representations, including:
  - Comparison of different tokenization methods
  - Evolution of word representation techniques
  - Visual representation of word vectors in semantic space
  - Mathematical properties of word embeddings
  - Explanation of modern contextual embeddings
